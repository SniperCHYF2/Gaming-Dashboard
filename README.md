this is a custom gaming dashboard with window integration for steam, discord, and chrome

you have to run the certificate (just double click on the .cer file) as this installs like a windows ass from the store. 

after you install the .cer file run the .msix file

after you install that you can just search for dashboard in the search bar and run the app. 

possibly more updates to come.
